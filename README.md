# Banking-Management-System

The bank management system is a program that keeps track of a person’s bank account. The system allows customers to create accounts, deposit/withdraw money from their accounts, and examine reports for all of their accounts. 
Bank relationship management (BRM) is a set of processes and technology that helps a firm track and manage all of its bank connections by giving them a single picture of all of their accounts and activity with a bank, anywhere in the world. Bank accounts, insurance, lines of credit, and foreign exchange are all examples of this. 
A bank account holder is a customer. “Bank depositors entrust their money, banking facilities, for storage and fruiting, for which they receive interest, and applicants or those who require temporary, additional money to pay interest or commission”
